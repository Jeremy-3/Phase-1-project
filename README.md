- This  application is very useful to user it can countless of games and without any drawbacks
- The event listeners that have been applied to make it more interactive are

  -  key down
  - submit

  - blur 

- One downfall to this application is that it is not that much interactive with the user in which he/she cannot purchase the desired game but changes will be implemented soon.

## requirements

- Implemented html,css,js,tailwind css

- Fetched data from a db.json(that I created)
